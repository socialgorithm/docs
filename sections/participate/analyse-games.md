## UABC Options

The `uabc` utility which you use to play games comes with some handy options.

* `-p` puts the client in practice mode
* `--log` enables logging to a file
* `--verbose` enables logging to the console
* `-f` defines the path to your executable player (for scripting languages like JavaScript or Python you may have to add `node` and `python` to the path, as seen in the example)

For an explanation of all the options run `uabc -h`.

### ProTip! Analyse Your Games

Logging to a **file** is very useful because you can then *[upload your log file](https://play.socialgorithm.org/replay)* to see the games and analyze the moves one by one.

For example, you can run `uabc -p --log --verbose -f "python3 run_player.py"`, and use your logfile to see:

Seriously, this is going to be *very* useful, **try it**!
